 * straight through from the arm. `linked` says what carries the arm, each
 * time the station greets it. `placed` is a case set on a belt, for the
 * hub to carry along it; `pallet` is one of the cell's own set down on a
 * slot, for the cases that arrive here; `idle` says the arm has nothing
 * to do, or has again. `struck` names the obstacles standing in the arm
 * as it is posed, or none once they are moved clear.
